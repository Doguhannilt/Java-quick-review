### What is `static` in Java?

In Java, `static` is a keyword that can be applied to variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes. When something is declared as `static`, it belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. This means that it is shared among all instances of the class.

### 1. **Static Variables**
A static variable (also known as a class variable) is shared among all instances of a class. This means that if you change the value of a static variable in one instance, that change will be reflected in all other instances as well.

**Example:**

```java
class Example {
    static int count = 0;

    Example() {
        count++;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `count` variable is shared across all instances of the `Example` class. Every time a new `Example` object is created, `count` is incremented. All instances of `Example` will see the same `count` value.

**Usage:**

```java
Example obj1 = new Example();
Example obj2 = new Example();
System.out.println(Example.count);  // Output: 2
```

### 2. **Static Methods**
Static methods belong to the class rather than any instance of the class. This means you can call a static method without creating an instance of the class. 

Static methods can only access static variables and other static methods. They cannot access instance variables or methods because they do not belong to any instance.

**Example:**

```java
class MathUtil {
    static int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}
```

You can call the `multiply` method directly using the class name without needing to create an object:

```java
int result = MathUtil.multiply(3, 5);  // Output: 15
```

### 3. **Static Blocks**
A static block is used to initialize static variables. It is executed when the class is loaded into memory, before any objects are created or any static methods are called.

**Example:**

```java
class Example {
    static int value;

    static {
        value = 42;
        System.out.println("Static block executed");
    }
}
```

When the `Example` class is loaded, the static block runs, and `value` is initialized.

### 4. **Static Classes**
In Java, you can have static nested classes. A static nested class is a nested class that does not have access to the instance variables and methods of the outer class. It can, however, access static members of the outer class.

**Example:**

```java
class OuterClass {
    static int outerValue = 10;

    static class NestedClass {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Outer value: " + outerValue);
        }
    }
}
```

You can use the nested class without creating an instance of the outer class:

```java
OuterClass.NestedClass nested = new OuterClass.NestedClass();
nested.display();  // Output: Outer value: 10
```

### Why Use `static`?

- **Memory Efficiency:** Static members are associated with the class itself rather than individual instances, which can save memory when multiple objects are created.
- **Utility Methods:** Static methods are useful for utility or helper functions that do not depend on object state (e.g., `Math.max()` or `Math.sqrt()`).
- **Shared Resources:** Static variables are ideal for representing shared resources or common properties across all objects (e.g., a counter that tracks how many instances of a class have been created).
- **Ease of Access:** Static members can be accessed directly using the class name, without needing to instantiate an object. This can make the code simpler and easier to read.

### When Not to Use `static`?
- **Instance-Specific Data:** If a variable or method needs to work with instance-specific data (data that differs from one object to another), it should not be static.
- **Polymorphism:** Static methods do not support polymorphism (method overriding). If you need polymorphism, the method should not be static.
- **Thread Safety:** Static variables, if not carefully managed, can lead to issues in a multi-threaded environment because they are shared across all instances.

### Conclusion
In summary, the `static` keyword in Java is a powerful tool that allows you to define class-level data and behavior. It is particularly useful for shared resources, utility methods, and constants. However, it should be used thoughtfully, as it introduces a different way of managing state and behavior that is distinct from the instance-based model of object-oriented programming.
